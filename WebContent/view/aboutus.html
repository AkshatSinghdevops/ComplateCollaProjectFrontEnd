"A Collaboration is a purposeful relationship in which all parties strategically choose to cooperate in order to achieve shared or overlapping objectives." In "Collaborative Leadership: Developing Effective Partnerships for Communities and Schools", Rubin explains "(b)ecause of its voluntary nature, 
the success of a collaboration depends on one or more collaborative leader's ability to build and maintain these relationships.”[1] Collaboration is very similar to, but more closely aligned than, cooperation. Most collaboration requires leadership, although the form of leadership can be social within a decentralized and egalitarian group.[2] Teams that work collaboratively can obtain greater resources, recognition and reward when facing competition for finite resources.[3]

Structured methods of collaboration encourage introspection of behavior and communication.[2] These methods specifically aim to increase the success of teams as they engage in collaborative problem solving.

Forms, rubrics, charts and graphs are useful in these situations to objectively document personal traits with the goal of improving performance in current and future projects. Collaboration is also present in opposing goals exhibiting the notion of adversarial collaboration, though this is not a common case for using the word.
